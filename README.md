# Dream-Device
This project is a voice-activated assistant designed for elderly users using a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It listens for speech through a Bluetooth microphone, converts it to text using offline speech recognition (Vosk), sends it to a remote LLM (Large Language Model) API, and optionally speaks the response aloud using text-to-speech.
